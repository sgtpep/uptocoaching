      <p>I turned to Ksenia when I started to have some difficulties with self-perception. I felt so miserable and self-conscious—sometimes I couldn't even pick up the phone to call somebody. I was totally at a loss not knowing what to do.</p>
      <p>Together we started working with my self-esteem and Ksenia empowered me with some tools of self-analysis which helped me to become more self-assured. As a result, I solved all the issues, which seemed to be absolutely impossible before.</p>
      <p>When I overcame the obstacles concerned with self-esteem, I understood that I was stuck in a rut with my career development. Everything seemed so obscure and impossible to reach. Ksenia kindly guided me towards my intrinsic aspirations about working life and showed me how I could prioritise my career tasks and achieve my goals.</p>
      <p>A couple of months later I once woke up a different person: aware of my strengths and weaknesses, having a clear-sighted vision of my future. Now I know what to do and where to go, what resources I have and how I can direct them. Coaching with Ksenia enabled me to take pause, step back and think strategically. My life has different colours now and the working prospects look so bright! That's an amazing feeling of freedom and confidence which I owe to Ksenia.</p>

      <p>I met Ksenia in the British Council Moscow where we worked together for about three years. Ksenia was leading on HR and I enjoyed a successful career in Marketing & Communications, growing from the role of Social Media Officer to Marketing Manager and later to Partnerships and Sponsorship Manager for arts projects.</p>
      <p>Throughout this journey I consulted with Ksenia several times at the turning points of my career. I always found support that helped me develop leadership skills and act upon my ambitions. Ksenia is the kind of coach who advises without giving advice — she asks questions and makes observations that trigger one's own true ambition and understanding. Ksenia helped me to formulate my long-term and short-term goals and create a plan for realising them.</p>
      <p>I am grateful for Ksenia's support when making a decision to take an MA course at Central Saint Martins College, University of the Arts, London. Today I live and work in London — I use my marketing skills and experience in the role of Development Manager for an events company and also pursue an independent career as a producer of arts projects.</p>

      <p>I approached Ksenia after an unsuccessful interview with a London-based startup and dozens of unanswered job applications. At that time, I worked in a financial institution in Moscow but was trying to get a job in a different area abroad to no avail. I wanted her to help me with this endeavour.</p>
      <p>Ksenia started out by refining my goals, which led me to a deeper understanding of my motives. She was extremely inspective to my words that didn't allow me to trick her or even myself. At the same time, she was very encouraging and energized me to continue my difficult path.</p>
      <p>We worked out a detailed plan for achieving my goals that she wrote down and sent over to me. She also monitored my results for several weeks helping me to stay on track. As a result of my work with Ksenia, I was offered the best position I could imagine in the UK!</p>

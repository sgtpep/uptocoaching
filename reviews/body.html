        I approached Ksenia after an unsuccessful interview with a London-based
        startup and dozens of unanswered job applications. At that time, I
        worked in a financial institution in Moscow but was trying to get a job
        in a different area abroad to no avail. I wanted her to help me with
        this endeavour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ksenia started out by refining my goals, which led me to a deeper
        understanding of my motives. She was extremely inspective to my words
        that didn't allow me to trick her or even myself. At the same time, she
        was very encouraging and energized me to continue my difficult path.
      </p>
      <p>
        We worked out a detailed plan for achieving my goals that she wrote down
        and sent over to me. She also monitored my results for several weeks
        helping me to stay on track. As a result of my work with Ksenia, I was
        offered the best position I could imagine in the UK!

        I contacted Ksenia with the aim to work on my marketing for my new
        coaching business. So, specifically to find out who I want to serve, how
        and why. At that point, I had already worked on myself and my marketing
        for a year by attending seminars, reading books by experts, watching
        webinars and listening to podcasts to answer my questions of who I
        wanted to serve etc. I was frustrated because I could not see any
        results, although I had put in so much energy and effort. I started to
        have self-doubt about my very goal and passion of my own coaching
        business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ksenia was able to structure my thoughts/chaos in my head by structuring
        the sessions with a clear focus that gave me the feeling of heading
        towards a goal step by step, instead of being overwhelmed and running
        around in the woods not knowing where to go.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many results and insights I gained in our sessions but my last
        session sums up the gains of all the coaching sessions. I was very
        specific with my goal (compared to before) and wanted to be able to sum
        up my service in one sentence to be able to take the next step in my
        business. Ksenia approached my wish very effectively and I had written
        down a sentence with the answer I was looking for for a year at the end
        of the session. Since then I keep walking my path step by step, full of
        energy and passion, because I finally know my direction I want to go.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am deeply grateful, Ksenia! Thank you very much for providing me with
        what I needed in this process!

        I met Ksenia in the British Council Moscow where we worked together for
        about three years. Ksenia was leading on HR and I enjoyed a successful
        career in Marketing & Communications, growing from the role of Social
        Media Officer to Marketing Manager and later to Partnerships and
        Sponsorship Manager for arts projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout this journey I consulted with Ksenia several times at the
        turning points of my career. I always found support that helped me
        develop leadership skills and act upon my ambitions. Ksenia is the kind
        of coach who advises without giving advice — she asks questions and
        makes observations that trigger one's own true ambition and
        understanding. Ksenia helped me to formulate my long-term and short-term
        goals and create a plan for realising them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am grateful for Ksenia's support when making a decision to take an MA
        course at Central Saint Martins College, University of the Arts, London.
        Today I live and work in London — I use my marketing skills and
        experience in the role of Development Manager for an events company and
        also pursue an independent career as a producer of arts projects.

        I turned to Ksenia when I started to have some difficulties with
        self-perception. I felt so miserable and self-conscious—sometimes I
        couldn't even pick up the phone to call somebody. I was totally at a
        loss not knowing what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together we started working with my self-esteem and Ksenia empowered me
        with some tools of self-analysis which helped me to become more
        self-assured. As a result, I solved all the issues, which seemed to be
        absolutely impossible before.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I overcame the obstacles concerned with self-esteem, I understood
        that I was stuck in a rut with my career development. Everything seemed
        so obscure and impossible to reach. Ksenia kindly guided me towards my
        intrinsic aspirations about working life and showed me how I could
        prioritise my career tasks and achieve my goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of months later I once woke up a different person: aware of my
        strengths and weaknesses, having a clear-sighted vision of my future.
        Now I know what to do and where to go, what resources I have and how I
        can direct them. Coaching with Ksenia enabled me to take pause, step
        back and think strategically. My life has different colours now and the
        working prospects look so bright! That's an amazing feeling of freedom
        and confidence which I owe to Ksenia.

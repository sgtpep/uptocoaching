      <p>Ksenia is the kind of coach who advises without giving advice — she asks questions and makes observations that trigger one's own true ambition and understanding. I am grateful for Ksenia's support when making a decision to take an MA course at Central Saint Martins College, University of the Arts, London.</p>

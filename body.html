      I envision a world where people are happy here and now and where they feel
      confident and comfortable with who they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a world where individuals are clear about their goals, in happy
      relationships and effective at work and in their personal lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      These individuals are courageous enough to challenge their own status quo,
      believe in themselves and fulfill their commitments to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>I am here to help these people realise their individual vision.</p>

        Coaching with Ksenia has changed my life a lot. I have never confided to
        anyone in my life as I did to Ksenia because I knew that she would not
        judge. That empowered me to communicate with other people more openly
        and not to dread disapproval. I have become more assertive. My
        relationship with my husband and children has also improved.

        She was extremely inspective to my words that didn't allow me to trick
        her or even myself. As a result of my work with Ksenia, I was offered
        the best position I could imagine in the UK!

        Ksenia is the kind of coach who advises without giving advice — she asks
        questions and makes observations that trigger one's own true ambition
        and understanding. I am grateful for Ksenia's support when making a
        decision to take an MA course at Central Saint Martins College,
        University of the Arts, London.

        Ksenia was able to structure my thoughts/chaos in my head by structuring
        the sessions with a clear focus that gave me the feeling of heading
        towards a goal step by step.

        Most of all I liked it how it helped to put my thoughts together. The
        questions triggered the thinking process and led to unexpected new
        solutions.

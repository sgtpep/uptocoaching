      I envision a world where people are happy here and now and where they feel
      confident and comfortable with who they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a world where individuals are clear about their goals, in happy
      relationships and effective at work and in their personal lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      These individuals are courageous enough to challenge their own status quo,
      believe in themselves and fulfill their commitments to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>I am here to help these people realise their individual vision.</p>

        She was extremely inspective to my words that didn't allow me to trick
        her or even myself. As a result of my work with Ksenia, I was offered
        the best position I could imagine in the UK!

        Ksenia is the kind of coach who advises without giving advice — she asks
        questions and makes observations that trigger one's own true ambition
        and understanding. I am grateful for Ksenia's support when making a
        decision to take an MA course at Central Saint Martins College,
        University of the Arts, London.

        Ksenia was able to structure my thoughts/chaos in my head by structuring
        the sessions with a clear focus that gave me the feeling of heading
        towards a goal step by step.

        Coaching with Ksenia has changed my life a lot. I have never confided to
        anyone in my life as I did to Ksenia because I knew that she would not
        judge. That empowered me to communicate with other people more openly
        and not to dread disapproval. I have become more assertive. My
        relationship with my husband and children has also improved.

        Most of all I liked it how it helped to put my thoughts together. The
        questions triggered the thinking process and led to unexpected new
        solutions.
